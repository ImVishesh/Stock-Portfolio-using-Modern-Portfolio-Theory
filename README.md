# Stock-Portfolio-using-Modern-Portfolio-Theory

Project Title: Portfolio Optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with Excel and Python

Description:
As part of my quantitative analysis and investment research endeavors, I undertook a comprehensive project to construct an investment portfolio comprising 22 stocks. The primary objective was to apply Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles to balance risk and return optimally.

Key Accomplishments and Methodology:

Excel-Based Portfolio Construction: Initially, I employed Microsoft Excel to design and create the portfolio. This phase involved meticulous data collection, including historical stock prices and risk metrics, and the formulation of asset allocation strategies based on expected returns and risk tolerance.

Risk-Return Analysis: In Excel, I conducted extensive risk-return analysis, calculating metrics such as expected returns, standard deviations, and covariance matrices. This analysis was crucial for optimizing the portfolio's asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies.

Python Implementation: Subsequently, I replicated the entire project in Python, utilizing data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy. This transition allowed for greater portfolio management flexibility, automation, and scalability.

Efficient Frontier and Portfolio Optimization: In both Excel and Python, I generated the efficient frontier, a critical component of MPT, to identify the optimal combination of assets that offered the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given expected return.

Risk Diversification: Through Excel and Python, I implemented diversification strategies to reduce portfolio risk, emphasizing the importance of uncorrelated asset selection in the portfolio construction process.

Performance Evaluation: I tracked and evaluated the portfolio's performance in both environments, using various metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and drawdown analysis to assess its effectiveness in achieving financial objectives.

Outcome:
This project enhanced my proficiency in financial analysis and showcased my ability to transition seamlessly between Excel and Python for quantitative tasks. By applying Modern Portfolio Theory, I successfully created an optimized investment portfolio, aligning with risk management principles and return maximization. This experience exemplifies my expertise in data-driven decision-making and investment strategies.

Overall, this project demonstrates my commitment to data-driven investment research and versatility in utilizing different tools and technologies to achieve robust financial solutions.
